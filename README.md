## 🔬 Systematic Approach

### What Worked ✅
1. **Domain Expertise Integration**: Retail knowledge drove breakthrough features
2. **Conservative Optimization**: Small, validated improvements compounded
3. **Quality Ensembling**: Homogeneous high-performing models
4. **Systematic Methodology**: Learning from failures guided success
5. **Feature Engineering Dominance**: 70.3% of model importance from engineered features

### What Failed ❌
1. **Multi-Algorithm Ensembles**: Weaker models diluted performance (+2.1 RMSE)
2. **Aggressive Parameter Tuning**: Caused overfitting (+4.4 RMSE)
3. **Target Encoding**: Data leakage despite precautions (+5.0 RMSE)
4. **Feature Selection**: Domain knowledge beat statistical selection (+2.0 RMSE)

## 💡 Key Learning
**Core Insight**: Deep domain understanding + disciplined machine learning execution beats algorithmic sophistication. The discovery that retail assortment diversity dominates sales prediction became the foundation for top 5% performance.
